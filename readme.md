## Overview

OSC control of grandMA3 faders with motorized feedback and backlit faders, 20 encoders, and 40 standard exec buttons.

> **Note:** This is a work in progress (WIP) but is fully functional. This is not a complete guide yet, as I just do not have the time to make one. However, here is a limited Bill of Materials (BOM).

Any questions can be sent to me at [stagehandshawn@gmail.com](mailto:stagehandshawn@gmail.com). I'll help when I can.

There are pinouts in the `images` and/or `docs` folders. These, along with the pictures, should give you an idea of how you'll want to route wires.

I have not coded in years and was never great at it, so I leaned on AI to make this happen. The code could use some work, I'm sure.

Image `00_Connections` gives an idea of the layout.

## Required repositories

There are 3 repositories you will need to complete this build. This one is the main controller. The other two are:

- **EvoFaderWing_keyboard_i2c**
- **EvoFaderWing_encoder_i2c**

These run on ATmega328p MCUs and are I2C slaves for getting encoder data from 20 encoders (5 each on 4 ATmega328p's), and 1 ATmega for the keyboard matrix.

There is a Python script and a `tasks.json` for uploading code automatically for when the FaderWing is closed and you cannot get to the bootloader button.

More to come. Thank you for checking out my project!

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

You will find most of the BOM here. I will add more when I can. You are probably going to need a decent amount of electronic building gear already, like a soldering iron and solder, wires, and general know-how of Arduino-type projects is a big help.

> **NOTICE:** If you enable serial debug, you will notice jitter in the faders. Serial debug **must be turned off when not debugging.**

### I2C & Power

- **I2C Breakout**  
  DFRobot DFR0759 from Mouser
- **DC to DC Converter**  
  DFR1015 from Mouser

### Wire

- Various sizes: 28 or 30 AWG for I/O. **Use at least 26 AWG PTFE for LEDs**â€”this will fit in the small space (if you use PTFE insulated wire) and be large enough for the current. **Cover power solder connections of the LEDs or they will short on the faders.** I also did power injection at the other end of the strip; this is what the second 12V connector on the first motor driver board is used for.

### Hardware

- M3 screws, 8 to 12mm, flat or buttonhead
- M3 heatset inserts

### Filament used
